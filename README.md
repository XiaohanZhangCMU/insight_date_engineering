The current compute time scaling with data size (24 cores desktop):

    --- 5 records finish in 0.21 seconds
    
    --- 100K records finish in 0.79 seconds
    
    --- 24525K records finish in 16.55 seconds 

Some features of the program:

    --- split large dataset into pieces and assign each piece to a processor to deals with large dataset exceeding memory size
    
    --- use regular expression to speed up parsing lines 
    
    --- replace ',' with '@' to simplify line splitting
